# all_in_one_C_Programs
This repo will contain a C program file which upon running after compilation should display a number of options that the user must choose. 
Each option corresponds to a funtion that does something (for example: simple area calculator, sorting numbers, percentage calculation from marks, file handling programs, games, etc)
Contributors can write new funtions without making any damage to the existing code, contributors should also update the option display for their new funtions.
Contributors can add new feature or better approach to already existing codes without affecting the purpose of the code.
